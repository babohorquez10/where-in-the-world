# Where In The World

## Technologies I used:

- NextJS.
- ReactJS.
- Tailwind CSS.
- Axios.
- Jest.
- React Testing Library.
- Redux (react-redux and redux-toolkit).

**Note**
I use redux for state-management in the ``main`` branch. Additionaly, there is another branch called ``local-state-management`` where I use local states.
